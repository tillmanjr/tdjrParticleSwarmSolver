# tdjrParticleSwarmSolver
Rig for playing with a Particle Swarm as a solver

Use the swarm to solve a function which is succeptible to local minima mistakes  
1. send details and results to `stdout`  
           `npm run node ./src/test.js`  
1. plot the swarms detailed movements to a surface graph  
           `browserify ./src/index.js > ./src/web/bundles/bundle.js`  _should not be needed_  
           load `./src/index.html` (browser, webserver...)
