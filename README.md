# tdjrParticleSwarmSolver
Rig for playing with using Particle Swarms for a solver

to use the swarm to solve a function which is succeptible to local minima mistakes  
      send details and results to `stdout`
           `npm run node ./src/test.js`  
      or plot the swarms detailed movements to a surface graph  
           `browserify ./src/index.js > ./src/web/bundles/bundle.js`  _should not be needed_  
           load `./src/index.html` (browser, webserver...)  

Thanks to ms research for insights
